#A casino player needs three randomly generated number between 1 and 20 to win the money. The three numbers must be generated individually and must be
random. For the player to win, the three randomly generated numbers must be identical. Your task is to write a program that can generate these numbers
individually, compare them, and print them out if the numbers are the same.

import random
    
lower = 1
upper = 20
x = random.randint(lower, upper)
y = random.randint(lower, upper)
z = random.randint(lower, upper)


while True:
   
    if (x==y) and (y==z):
        print("You Win")
        break
    
    elif (x==z):
        if x == y or y == z:
            y = random.randint(lower, upper)
            print("So Close")
            break
        else:
            print("Nice Try")
            break
            
    elif (x==y):
        
        
        if x == z or y == z:
            z = random.randint(lower, upper)
            print("So Close")
            break
        
        else:
            print("Nice Try")
            print(x,y,z)
            break

    else:
        print("You Lost")
        break
print(x,y,z)
